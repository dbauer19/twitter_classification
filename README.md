# twitter_classification

In this project, real tweets are used to build models in order to find patterns in the way people use social media.

There are two parts to this project, split into two separate Jupyter Notebooks.

In 'viral_tweets.ipynb', a model was built that predicts whether or not a tweet will go viral by using a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier. A main goal of this classifier is to determine which features of a tweet have the greatest impact on its potential to go viral.

In 'tweet_location.ipynb', the power of Naive Bayes classifiers is tested by creating a system that predicts whether a tweet was sent from New York City, London, or Paris. The purpose of this classifier is to determine if it can automatically detect the difference between French and English. Additionally, it will be interesting to observe if the classifier can learn local phrases or slang.
